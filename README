OSGiraffe
=========
OSGiraffe is a demo application that shows how to build Swing applications that run on all platforms.

Specifically, it contains build scripts that will create a standard Mac OS X application.

OSGiraffe uses the Eclipse Equinox framework (http://www.eclipse.org/equinox/). The source code does not specifically reference it, only the build files and configuration do.

Instructions
============
To run the application from the command line, use:

  ant run

To build a version of the application for your platform, use:

  ant dist-mac # For Mac OS X
  ant dist # For all other platforms

The application ends up in the "dist" folder.

To clean out all build files:

  ant clean
